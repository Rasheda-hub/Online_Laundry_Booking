# Booking Restriction Update

## Overview
Enhanced the shop availability feature to **prevent customers from booking when a shop is closed**.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Validation (`backend/routes/bookings.py`)

**Added availability check in booking creation:**

```python
# Line 76-85
prov = session.run(
    "MATCH (p:User {id: $pid, role: 'provider'}) RETURN p.provider_status AS st, coalesce(p.is_available, true) AS is_available",
    pid=payload.provider_id,
).single()
if not prov:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Provider not found")
if prov["st"] != ProviderStatus.approved.value:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Provider not approved")
if not prov["is_available"]:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="This shop is currently closed and not accepting bookings")
```

**What it does:**
- Checks if provider exists and is approved
- **NEW**: Checks if provider's `is_available` is `true`
- Returns `400 Bad Request` with clear error message if shop is closed
- Prevents booking creation at the API level

---

### 2. Frontend UI Prevention (`frontend-react/src/pages/customer/Dashboard.jsx`)

#### A. Warning Banner for Closed Shops

Added a prominent warning message when a closed shop is selected:

```jsx
{providers.find(p => p.id === selectedProvider)?.is_available === false && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 text-red-800 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
    <div className="flex items-start gap-2">
      <span className="text-xl">⚠️</span>
      <div>
        <div className="font-semibold">Shop Currently Closed</div>
        <div className="text-sm mt-1">This shop is not accepting bookings at the moment. Please check back later or choose another provider.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

#### B. Disabled Booking Buttons

Modified category cards to disable booking for closed shops:

```jsx
{categories.map(cat => {
  const provider = providers.find(p => p.id === selectedProvider)
  const isClosed = provider?.is_available === false
  
  return (
    <div key={cat.id} className={`card ${isClosed ? 'opacity-60' : 'hover:scale-105'}`}>
      {/* ... category details ... */}
      <button 
        onClick={()=>{
          if (isClosed) {
            alert('This shop is currently closed and not accepting bookings.')
            return
          }
          nav('/customer/book', { state: { provider_id: cat.provider_id, category: cat } })
        }} 
        disabled={isClosed}
        className={`w-full ${isClosed ? 'btn-white cursor-not-allowed' : 'btn-primary'}`}
      >
        {isClosed ? '🔒 Shop Closed' : '📝 Book Now'}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
})}
```

**What it does:**
- Detects if selected provider is closed
- Dims category cards (60% opacity)
- Changes button text to "🔒 Shop Closed"
- Disables button (cursor-not-allowed)
- Shows alert if user tries to click
- Prevents navigation to booking form

---

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Customer Tries to Book from Closed Shop

1. **Provider List View:**
   - Closed shops show 🔴 Closed badge
   - Shop card appears dimmed (60% opacity)

2. **Customer Selects Closed Shop:**
   - Categories load normally
   - **⚠️ Warning banner appears** at the top:
     > "Shop Currently Closed - This shop is not accepting bookings at the moment. Please check back later or choose another provider."

3. **Customer Views Categories:**
   - All category cards appear dimmed
   - "Book Now" buttons show "🔒 Shop Closed"
   - Buttons are disabled (grayed out)

4. **Customer Clicks Button:**
   - Alert popup: "This shop is currently closed and not accepting bookings."
   - No navigation occurs

5. **If Customer Bypasses Frontend (Direct API Call):**
   - Backend returns `400 Bad Request`
   - Error message: "This shop is currently closed and not accepting bookings"

---

### Scenario 2: Provider Closes Shop While Customer is Browsing

1. Customer is viewing open shop's categories
2. Provider toggles availability to "Closed"
3. Customer tries to book
4. Backend validation catches it
5. Error message displayed: "This shop is currently closed and not accepting bookings"
6. Customer redirected back to dashboard

## Security & Validation

### Multi-Layer Protection:

1. **Frontend UI Layer:**
   - Visual indicators (badges, dimming)
   - Disabled buttons
   - Warning messages
   - Alert dialogs

2. **Frontend Logic Layer:**
   - Click handler checks availability
   - Prevents navigation to booking form

3. **Backend API Layer:**
   - Database query checks `is_available`
   - Returns 400 error if closed
   - **Cannot be bypassed** by API calls
